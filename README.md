# guerrilla

The goal of guerrilla is to provide an easy introduction to
interpolation of irregular data. The motivation is to help find a simple
answer, not to ensure you do the most rigourous modelling possible
(that’s *your* job!).

We think the tools shouldn’t get in the way of exploring and not
everything **spatial** is *geo-spatial*.

Raise issues here if you want something or have questions!
