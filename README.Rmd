# irreg

The goal of irreg is to provide an easy introduction to interpolation of irregular data. Our
main motivation is to help find a simple answer, not to ensure you do the most rigourous
modelling possible (that's *your* job!) We just think the tools shouldn't get in the way 
of exploring.

For now, there's a vignette with a series of examples of data interpolation in R.

This package really only provides a few functions used, it's the examples that show how
to use a wide variety of R packages for **this kind of thing**. 

For actual modelling be sure to check out more formal resources.
