# guerrilla

The goal of guerrilla is to provide an easy introduction to interpolation of irregular data. 
The motivation is to help find a simple answer, not to ensure you do the most rigourous
modelling possible (that's *your* job!). 

We think the tools shouldn't get in the way of exploring and not everything **spatial** is *geo-spatial*.
